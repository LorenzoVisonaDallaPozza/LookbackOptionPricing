/**
 * Abstract base class for Monte Carlo pricing of lookback options.
 *
 * <p>This class provides common utilities shared by all concrete lookback products, such as:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Construction of monitoring times for continuously and discretely monitored payoffs.</li>
 *     <li>Pathwise computation of the running maximum and minimum of the underlying.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Concrete subclasses are expected to implement {@link #getValue(double, AssetModelMonteCarloSimulationModel)}
 * to define the specific payoff (call/put, fixed/floating strike, etc.).
